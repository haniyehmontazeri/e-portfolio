							<p>Top 10 OWASP Vulnerabilities for 20:</p>
							OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for 2021 (as of September 2021):

    						Injection: This vulnerability occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended execution of commands or unauthorized data access.
    						<br><br>
							Broken Authentication: This vulnerability refers to weaknesses in the authentication and session management mechanisms, such as weak passwords, session fixation, or improper implementation of multi-factor authentication.
    						<br><br>
							Sensitive Data Exposure: This vulnerability involves the exposure of sensitive data due to improper handling or storage, weak encryption, or inadequate protection of data in transit.
    						<br><br>
							XML External Entities (XXE): This vulnerability occurs when an application parses XML input insecurely, allowing an attacker to exploit external entities, leading to disclosure of internal files, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.
    						<br><br>
							Broken Access Control: This vulnerability refers to flaws in access control mechanisms, such as insufficient authorization checks, insecure direct object references, or misconfiguration, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
    						<br><br>
							Security Misconfiguration: This vulnerability arises from insecure configurations, such as default credentials, unnecessary features enabled, missing security patches, or improper security settings.
    						<br><br>
							Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
    						<br><br>
							Insecure Deserialization: This vulnerability occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, leading to remote code execution, injection attacks, or privilege escalation.
    						<br><br>
							Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: This vulnerability arises from using outdated or vulnerable components, frameworks, or libraries, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    						<br><br>
							Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This vulnerability relates to inadequate logging and monitoring, which hinders timely detection and response to security incidents, making it difficult to identify and investigate breaches.

    Security scanning

    As the foundation of any security solution, vulnerability scanning provides much-needed oversight. This is a first line of defense, as it reveals where key vulnerabilities exist and whether any urgent threats need to be addressed.
    <br><br>
	Encryption
	
    The need for strong encryption cannot be overstated. After all, the latest version of the OWASP Top 10 includes a revised category focused exclusively on cryptographic failures. SSL certificates remain the standard for producing encrypted links between clients and servers.
    <br><br>
	Log files
	
    OWASP cites security logging as one of the most impactful strategies for verifying current security and boosting protection moving forward. Logging is available for everything from network devices and web servers to database servers and even custom application events. These logs are especially valuable for identifying and monitoring security incidents and policy violations.
    <br><br>
	Authorization

    Defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as "the process of verifying that a requested action or service is approved for a specific entity," authorization should not be confused with authentication. The former simply reveals whether users have access rights. The aforementioned principle of least privilege applies here, but a deny-by-default mentality must also be implemented. Simply put, this means that all traffic that's not explicitly permitted must be denied.
    <br><br>
	Authentication

    Confirming that all individuals or entities are, in fact, who they claim to be, authentication processes verify identity and, ideally, will ensure that the most problematic parties are denied access. User IDs and passwords are the core components of modern authentication. OWASP also recommends Transport Layer Security (TLS) for login pages, as well as re-authentication to prevent session hijacking or cross-site request forgery.
